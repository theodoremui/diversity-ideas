are we at Columbia, and what is the purpose of higher education? Many of us arrived at Columbia fueled by curiosity and a yearning for knowledge. However, in recent months, it has become clear that not all members of our community share a vision of open dialogue and mutual learning."},{"content":"We can see these divisions playing out in current campus discourse, including in Amine Bit’s recent op-ed in Spectator titled “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/12/02/on-reckless-criticism-and-propaganda/\\">On reckless criticism and propaganda</a>.” In the editorial, Mr. Bit challenges our arguments and ideas by impugning our credibility and accusing us—proud members of the Jewish community—of misrepresenting Jewish identity in a number of our published articles."},{"content":"To be sure, there is a lot we could respond to in Mr. Bit’s personal condemnation."},{"content":"However, we believe it is imperative that we first address a much greater issue with the author’s piece, rather than his distortion of our arguments and delegitimization of our identities. In fact, Mr. Bit’s piece is not only about attacking <a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRQgyDhIjZupO2H-2rIDXLy_zkf76RoM-_ZIYsOfn9FkI7TETgRtOfXK9VobMvGh6iEZfDPgALXJTCR/pub\\">hundreds of proud and outspoken Jews at Columbia</a>, but rather a fundamental rejection of the core tenets of a liberal arts education."},{"content":"Mr. Bit concludes his op-ed “by decidedly declaring that my response is not the beginning of a dialogue.” He elaborates, “I am not interested in discussing these points over coffee. My greatest endeavor in this response, in this <i>criticism</i>, has not been to ennoble my target, but rather, to strike it—to shatter the possibility that these pieces, by virtue of not having been responded to, could represent a normalized campus discourse.”"},{"content":"It should go without saying that declaring war—by stating his intent to “strike”—on the stated experiences of Zionist students at Columbia, his “target,” is antithetical to a university’s ethical values. As importantly, it is antithetical to our <a href=\\"https://www.columbia.edu/content/about-columbia#:~:text=University%20Mission%20Statement,its%20efforts%20to%20the%20world.&text=If%20playback%20doesn%27t%20begin%20shortly%2C%20try%20restarting%20your%20device\\">academic mission</a>. Especially at Columbia, the home of the Core Curriculum, critical engagement with diverse perspectives and big ideas is a moral and intellectual imperative. What could be further from the values of engagement and diversity than a public rejection of dialogue with a certain <i>type</i> of student?"},{"content":"One cannot just declare, as Mr. Bit does, that history, acting as an independent force, will relegate certain arguments “to the dustbin” on its own. To borrow a concept <a href=\\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/250/616\\">from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>, let these arguments compete in the marketplace of ideas. We presume that Mr. Bit’s stated objective, to “strike”  rather than engage with us, is a metaphor for winning an argument. If that is the case, let us engage with his argument. Mr. Bit seems to expect that he, a non-Jew, can criticize and invalidate our Jewish identities—an egregious overstep, to say the least—and then walk away from the conversation altogether. At the risk of disappointing him, we decidedly declare that one cannot win an argument by rejecting his counterparts and refusing to face challenges to his own claims."},{"content":"We believe there is a time and a place for debate about issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, University governance structures, and the fundamental purpose of a university. Unlike Mr. Bit, we are willing to be challenged and eager to grapple with hard questions and different perspectives. Unfortunately, Mr. Bit’s article displays the opposite approach, embodying one of the most significant problems plaguing our campus: widespread refusal to engage different perspectives with openness and curiosity, often in the name of activism and “justice.”"},{"content":"In January, for example, Columbia University Apartheid Divest <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/01/19/pro-palestinian-student-groups-hold-divestment-now-rally-on-low-steps-call-for-tuition-strike/\\">protested</a> against Barnard’s “Day of Dialogue,” with CUAD organizers openly calling for a boycott of such initiatives altogether. Students like Mr. Bit and the organizers of CUAD are not lone wolves fighting against Columbia’s core values. The culture of nonengagement at Columbia runs deeper than the behavior of particular students; they are taking their cues from some loud faculty members who also have expressed views that run completely counter to what a university should be."},{"content":"Among the faculty, we have observed similar conduct, including when a group of faculty members supported and participated in the <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/01/19/pro-palestinian-student-groups-hold-divestment-now-rally-on-low-steps-call-for-tuition-strike/\\">protest encouraging the boycott of the “Days of Dialogue” in January</a>. This year, such behavior has occurred frequently in the context of ongoing internal discussions about University governance. For context, on October 15, more than <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/10/16/over-250-community-members-sign-a-petition-expressing-concern-over-possible-reelection-of-university-senate-chair/\\">250 community members</a> signed a <a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSxcI67hGnDmAOpqwJ7FZQ8NOh2rvfaQGQ-cxkmu5MCP2l92H4cUCyFu4yWk6BxsylWAoUr6cRLHHWh/pub#ftnt7\\">petition</a> advocating for “best practices and good governance” within the University Senate. The proposal includes limiting the term of the executive committee chair to two terms, reviewing committee representation, instituting whistleblower policies, developing a code of ethics, and increasing transparency."},{"content":"Regardless of one’s personal opinions on the substance of the petition, these proposals and allegations warrant robust discussion for the sake of strengthening our institutions of governance. Yet some senators have openly dismissed the petition as not even worth discussing."},{"content":"On October 28, a counter-petition that sought to shut down debate by characterizing itself as “<a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14-YcWL15elEE4P7boU2ZiiWJOAMc-2LaNSyIow32Ex0/edit?tab=t.0\\">in support</a>” of the University Senate was circulated. The implication that the original petition was anti-senate is a perfect example of refusing to engage with arguments in good faith. And when the counter-petition did comment on substantive proposals, it simply misrepresented the original petition, suggesting falsely that the original petition sought to advance for-profit governance principles when in fact the original petition cited best practices for nonprofits like Columbia. Name-calling and misinformation should not be considered good-faith discourse around campus governance."},{"content":"The recent <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/12/02/university-senators-respond-to-allegations-of-partiality-raised-against-senate-chair/\\">senate plenary meeting</a> on November 22 was no less disturbing. One senator said, “I want to condemn in the strongest possible terms this petition as a waste of everyone’s time, both institutionally and individually.” Another affirmed his agreement “about the problem that we’re considering some of this seriously.”"},{"content":"These examples highlight the disappointing trend among members of our community who simply refuse to participate in critical, good-faith conversation with those who hold opposing points of view. Curiosity and openness are essential prerequisites in an institution of higher learning such as our own. Promoting these qualities can thus only enrich our shared intellectual environment. Those who undermine these values call into question the entire purpose of higher education as we see it."},{"content":"With this in mind, we wholeheartedly reiterate our commitment to fostering meaningful dialogue with our peers, especially those with whom we have profound disagreements. Although we stress that the legitimacy of our Jewish identities should not be up for debate (surely no other minority identity would be subject to such denialism), we welcome robust discussions about campus governance reform, Israel, and more. These discussions are not a waste of time; they are a critical step toward making Columbia a better place. Lastly, despite Amine Bit’s fervent objections, we renew our invitation to anyone who disagrees with us, wants to understand us, wants to criticize us, or is willing to share their own perspective: Coffee is on us."},{"content":"<i>Elisha Baker is a third-year undergraduate studying Middle Eastern history and a co-chair of Columbia Aryeh.

These representatives participating on behalf of Columbia include Lisa Sachs, Jeffrey Sachs, Lisa Dale, Jeffrey Shaman, and Andrew Kruczkiewicz. All chose to attend COP29 on behalf of the University despite increasing calls to <a href=\\"https://actionnetwork.org/letters/stop-cop29-from-being-held-in-a-genocidal-petro-state\\">boycott</a> the conference on account of Azerbaijan’s horrific record of human rights abuses—the most egregious being the <a href=\\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-azerbaijani-regime-ethnically-cleansed-nagorno-karabakh-according-international\\">ethnic cleansing</a> of Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. This comes amid accusations that Azerbaijan is using COP29 to <a href=\\"https://theconversation.com/azerbaijan-is-using-cop29-to-peacewash-its-global-image-239960\\">sanitize its public image</a>, a tactic known as “greenwashing.”"},{"content":"Azerbaijan, an <a href=\\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan\\">authoritarian</a> petro-state where oil and gas make up <a href=\\"https://www.iea.org/reports/azerbaijan-energy-profile/overview#:~:text=Oil%20and%20gas%20make%20up,reach%20record%20levels%20in%202010.\\">90 percent of its exports</a>, appears an odd choice to host perhaps the world’s most important conference on climate change. Despite its economic dependence on fossil fuels, Azerbaijan secured the bid to host COP29 only after pressuring the Republic of Armenia to <a href=\\"https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/4925292-letting-azerbaijan-host-the-un-climate-conference-is-a-sick-joke/\\">drop its veto</a> in exchange for the release of Armenian prisoners of war.

On November 8, <a href=\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmzvdn9e18o\\">BBC reported</a> that the chief executive of Azerbaijan’s COP29 team was using the conference as an opportunity to boost investments into the state’s oil and gas companies, citing a meeting held in secret. The same week, the president of Azerbaijan was <a href=\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqd1rzw9r4o\\">quoted</a> as saying their oil and gas reserves were a “gift of God.”"},{"content":"Before 2023, the Republic of Artsakh, or <a href=\\"https://eurasianet.org/the-nagorno-karabakh-republic-the-life-and-death-of-an-unrecognized-state\\">Nagorno-Karabakh Republic</a>, was inhabited by a majority ethnic Armenian population and functioned with <a href=\\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/nagorno-karabakh\\">de facto independence</a> since the 1990s, despite remaining internationally unrecognized as a state. Starting in December 2022, Azerbaijan <a href=\\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/02/azerbaijan-blockade-of-lachin-corridor-putting-thousands-of-lives-in-peril-must-be-immediately-lifted/\\">blockaded</a> the Lachin Corridor, the only road between Artsakh and Armenia, generating a massive human rights crisis by preventing food, fuel, and medicine from entering Artsakh. After nine months of blockade conditions, Azerbaijani officials launched a <a href=\\"https://humanrightsnetwork.shorthandstories.com/we-are-no-one/we-are-no-one-all-chapters/chapter-8-the-last-voices-from-artsakh/index.html\\">military operation</a> in September 2023, which led to the forced displacement of Artsakh’s entire remaining population of over 100,000 residents—an act of <a href=\\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-azerbaijani-regime-ethnically-cleansed-nagorno-karabakh-according-international\\">ethnic cleansing</a>. This was not the first attempt to ethnically cleanse Armenian inhabitants but the culmination of years of violence and attempts to rid Artsakh of Armenians. Alarmingly, the Azerbaijani government has presented plans for a “<a href=\\"https://crudeaccountability.org/azerbaijans-green-energy-development-serves-the-hydrocarbon-industry/\\">Green Energy Zone</a>” in occupied Artsakh as a critical component of its renewable energy sector, flaunting the prospect of net-zero carbon emissions. By allowing Azerbaijan to host COP29 in spite of its flagrant disregard for human rights, the United Nations has effectively legitimized the practice of ethnic cleansing as a means of reducing emissions."},{"content":"Still, the host of COP29 had the audacity to frame the summit as “<a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/05/cop29-summit-to-call-for-peace-between-warring-states-says-host-azerbaijan\\">the COP of peace</a>.” Environmental activist Greta Thunberg critiqued such comments in <a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/greta-thunberg-cop29-authoritarian-human-rights-azerbaijan-greenwashing\\">a scathing article</a> published in The Guardian where she called out the Azerbaijani government not only for its hypocrisy in planning to <a href=\\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/23/cop29-host-azerbaijan-set-for-major-fossil-gas-expansion-report-says\\">increase fossil fuel production</a> but also for its recent human rights violations in Artsakh. Moreover, Thunberg implicates Azerbaijan in the ongoing human rights violations of Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank, as it supplies Israel with <a href=\\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/azerbaijan-appoints-first-ever-ambassador-israel-amid-iran-row-2023-01-11/\\">40 percent of its oil imports</a>, in what she describes as “fueling the Israeli war machine.”"},{"content":"Over email, Jeffrey Sachs, one of the representatives of Columbia in Baku, told a member of the Armenian Society that we should “focus concerns on peace and justice in the region, while also supporting the UN in its crucial and urgent work in addressing the climate crisis.” He also said that we should feel “proud” of the Climate School’s participation in the conference."},{"content":"As students who are not only Armenian but will also have to live in a world constructed in part by COP29 representatives, we are deeply concerned about the disregard of human rights conditions, ethnic cleansing, and the impending climate catastrophe Azerbaijan continues to play a role in upholding."},{"content":"The crucial and urgent work that needs to be done does not involve climate action that is beholden to the whims of a petro-state. Appeasing a government that has continuously denied the voices of climate leaders within Azerbaijan and the United States will get us nowhere. We have faith that the Climate School is capable of doing positive work in the interest of the health of our planet. However, it is disappointing that they have decided to take a route that prioritizes political agenda and petroleum profit over environmental justice and also normalizes and accepts the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh. We ask that the Climate School reconsider its unwavering support for COP and its decision to send a delegation every year.

In it, he suggests that the treatment of Zionist students is akin to the experience of Dred Scott, an American slave who in 1857 had his case dismissed by the Supreme Court on the grounds that Black Americans did not hold citizenship. Baker argues that, similar to Dred Scott, Zionists on campus have been silenced solely on the basis of their identity before even being heard, writing that CCSC was forcing “the University community to litigate the existence of an entire group of people.”"},{"content":"It’s important to recognize that this piece, as outrageous as it is and as displeased as I was with it, did not emerge without precedent. Since the beginning of the war on Gaza, between letters to the editor and op-eds, Spectator’s opinion section has published over a dozen pieces by students who self-identify as Zionists. Some are more personal, like in the case of David Lederer’s “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/03/08/why-i-counterprotest-sjp-rallies/\\">Why I counterprotest SJP rallies</a>” or Baker, Eliana Goldin, and Eden Yadegar’s “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/07/12/president-shafik-save-columbias-soul/\\">President Shafik, save Columbia’s soul</a>.” Other pieces attempt to venture more into criticism, such as Baker’s “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/06/22/on-tokenism-and-the-denial-of-antisemitism/\\">On tokenism and the denial of antisemitism</a>.”"},{"content":"As one reads through these articles, they will find that as absurd as Baker’s argument was, it was not a simple argumentative misstep. Rather, I argue, it is emblematic of a rhetorical throughline in op-eds published by Zionists at Columbia: a reckless criticism that has had immensely damaging intellectual, physical, and psychological consequences."},{"content":"I will start with the op-ed, “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/06/22/on-tokenism-and-the-denial-of-antisemitism/\\">On tokenism and the denial of antisemitism</a>,” which served as an elaboration on an <a href=\\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRQgyDhIjZupO2H-2rIDXLy_zkf76RoM-_ZIYsOfn9FkI7TETgRtOfXK9VobMvGh6iEZfDPgALXJTCR/pub\\">open letter</a> written by Rivka Yellin, Goldin, Yadegar, and Baker."},{"content":"Quoting the open letter, Baker defines Zionism in his op-ed as the belief “in the Jewish People’s right to self-determination in our historic homeland,” which, again citing the open letter, he describes as “a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity.” But the problems begin immediately in the piece, starting with the fact that Baker’s claim has no root of any kind in critical scholarship or serious investigation. You can not make statements of this caliber—about an entire identity and what qualifies or disqualifies it—without substantiating them."},{"content":"There is some discussion of other definitions in different op-eds, such as Nick Baum’s editorial “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/04/02/why-do-jews-tend-to-support-zionism/\\">Why do Jews tend to support Zionism?</a>” where he engages in some discussion of both the Oxford English Dictionary’s and Al Jazeera’s respective definitions. However, there is not a semblance of this level of critical thinking in Baker’s piece. Instead, his op-ed is based on an open letter containing the testimonies of four students—including himself—who relied on anecdotal evidence and who then went on to justify its accuracy through the agreement of <i>any</i> student who held the same perspective."},{"content":"Even considering that this argument is reinforced entirely by affirmation, I will say that the primary object of my criticism here is not necessarily what has been said but what is <i>missing</i>: that Zionism, as Rashid Khalidi and <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7xAPcFLPDY\\">other scholars</a> have constantly argued, has also been defined as an ideology of national liberation <i>and </i>settler-colonialism. The problem with the definition of Zionism that Baker and other Zionists have used is not necessarily the definition itself, but rather that it is the <i>exclusive </i>definition and one that is conditioned on the dispossession and systematic elimination of other inhabitants of the land—Palestinians."},{"content":"The second clause of Baker’s definition of Zionism is even more controvertible: that Zionism is “a fundamental tenet of Jewish identity.” When you premise a political discussion of Zionism as one of absolute rejection versus absolute acceptance, you become a perennial victim and therefore label anyone who opposes you, anyone who is anti-Zionist, a violent aggressor. This is stated explicitly in Baker’s op-ed “On tokenism and the denial of antisemitism,” in which Baker writes that “Anti-Zionism can thus be defined as the denial of this right, the belief that Jews do not have a right to self-determination in their historic homeland.”"},{"content":"The writers of the op-ed “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/06/11/task-force-on-antisemitism-can-you-hear-us-now/\\">Task Force on Antisemitism, can you hear us now?</a>” make their understanding of Zionism clear when they remark that “Zionism is a political ideology—not an ethnic or religious identity,” and point to the fact that many of them, despite being Zionists when they were younger, no longer subscribe to it. Baker, however chooses not to contend with anti-Zionist Jews’ refusal to have their self-determination be predicated on violence, but with their <i>Jewishness</i> itself. Through his definition, Baker rejects anti-Zionist Jews’<i> </i>understanding of their own identities<i> </i>entirely, pointing to unverifiable student signatures on a petition as evidence of the substance of his position. For all of Baker and Yadegar’s <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/07/12/president-shafik-save-columbias-soul/\\">emphasis on a “rise of illiberalism</a>” on campus, Baker’s total rejection of standard practices of empirical investigation is an incredibly radical position."},{"content":"We see firsthand here the dangers of inept criticism. In one fell swoop, Baker and his comrades—who include the former president of Columbia Students Supporting Israel and co-chairs of Columbia Aryeh, which defines itself as “<a href=\\"https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/studentgroup/aryeh\\">Columbia’s pro-Israel public affairs committee</a>”—have categorically excluded and ostracized scores of Jewish students who politically disagree with them, essentially designating them as <i>personae non gratae </i>in all aspects of Jewish life on campus."},{"content":"It does not take long for one to see the effects of this kind of rhetoric. Anti-Zionist Jews on campus have been <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/23/business-school-professor-shai-davidai-denied-access-to-morningside-campus-ahead-of-planned-entry-into-encampment/\\">met with slurs</a>, including some which are used pejoratively to refer to Jews who seem to betray their own communities, and are particularly venomous considering many anti-Zionist Jews on campus have lost family members in the Holocaust. Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai, for example, <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/04/18/you-have-failed-your-jewish-students-endjewhatred-holds-rally-in-support-of-shai-davidai-calls-for-shafiks-resignation/\\">has gone on the record using these terms</a> to describe students in Columbia’s chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and Columbia University Jews for Ceasefire. While these terms have not been used in the editorials referenced here, these articles embolden this bigotry through normalization."},{"content":"Furthermore, creating a definition for Zionism in which anyone who opposes you is an enemy of Jewish identity has allowed for exceptionally vulgar remarks, and nowhere is this more apparent than in how these pieces describe Palestinian and Arab students. Baker, Goldin, and Yadegar say, for example, that anti-Zionist Arab and Muslim activists do not protest, but engage in <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/07/12/president-shafik-save-columbias-soul/\\">“cult-like” rituals.</a> Lederer’s “<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/03/08/why-i-counterprotest-sjp-rallies/\\">Why I counterprotest SJP rallies</a>” op-ed creates an egregious parallel between keffiyeh-wearing students and Hamas terrorists, remarking: “When said by a Columbia student wearing a keffiyeh or a Hamas terrorist in Kfar Aza, ‘end to the Zionist state’ means the same thing to me: dead Jews, and the destruction of the Jewish state.” Lederer then goes on to say, with regard to pro-Palestine protesters—some of whom are themselves Palestinian—that he is “more concerned about Palestinian suffering and Palestinian self-determination than they are.”"},{"content":"Let us not mince words here: in this instance, “terrorist” is not a nuanced academic term or expression. It is a slur and one that has constantly been used to delegitimize the humanity of Arabs and Muslims as well as legitimize violence against them. Additionally—and I can’t believe I have to say this—to suggest that you care more about Palestinian suffering than students who have family members who are being killed, bombed, starved, and expelled from their homes is terribly appalling. And to add insult to injury, after paragraphs of vicious attacks and self-righteous indignation, Lederer ends his article by kindly inviting anyone who disagrees with him to have respectful dialogue, saying that he is <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/03/08/why-i-counterprotest-sjp-rallies/\\">“always open for a coffee chat.”</a>"},{"content":"When you make these kinds of suggestions—that students protesting Columbia’s complicity in perpetuating the war in Gaza are akin to mindless terrorist sympathizers and that you care more about Palestinian life than them—it opens the way for protesters, and the identities especially associated with them, to be rendered open to trial by harassment. This leads to Muslim students getting arrested and having<a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-it-means-to-be-muslim-at-columbia/\\"> their hijabs ripped off</a> and<a href=\\"https://www.newarab.com/opinion/i-covered-columbia-gaza-encampment-then-i-was-investigated\\"> Arab student journalists being unjustly put under investigation</a> by the University, and superlatively, the abasing of Palestinian humanity. It is also worth recognizing that this kind of rhetoric has run strikingly parallel with how the University has dealt with disciplinary proceedings, with <a href=\\"https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_republican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf\\">deans directly interfering in pro-Palestine student disciplinary cases</a> and even <a href=\\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/548748b1e4b083fc03ebf70e/t/662ab1fbe670b111f6bb75ea/1714074108256/2024.04.25+-+Title+VI+Complaint+Against+Columbia+University.pdf\\">taking disciplinary action against students participating in a vigil in support of Palestinian rights.</a>"},{"content":"Yet, perhaps the most central argument of these editorials is an emphasis on the so-called exceptionalism of the silencing of Zionist voices. The authors constantly affirm that there cannot possibly be another explanation for the treatment of Zionists on campus other than a unilateral refusal on the basis of identity. At the same time, despite this seemingly insurmountable reality, these pieces are obsessed with proving themselves to be worthy of dialogue. They crudely use academic jargon and polemics and are steeped in an overwhelming sanctimoniousness. Certain political positions are not just poorly sustained, but <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/03/08/why-i-counterprotest-sjp-rallies/\\">“morally corrupt”</a>; they are not just inadequately developed, but <a href=\\"https://www.columbiaspectator.com/opinion/2024/07/12/president-shafik-save-columbias-soul/\\">“unconscionable.”</a> I will take my criticism one step forward: These pieces are intellectually violent."},{"content":"I would be derelict in my duty here as a critic if I were not to mention that the material stakes of this discourse are both physical <i>and</i> mental.

And no, no amount of listening tables, lawn picnics, or messages to our community can ameliorate this suffering. This is not the kind of despair that can be rebuked with statements or slogans."},{"content":"The stakes of these kinds of articles are immense because they are, at their core, concerned with who gets to be regarded as a human being. Whether Baker, Yadegar, or Lederer have intended or not to engender these consequences is irrelevant because the reality is that their carelessness is culpable in and of itself. These pieces, which rely on preposterous parallels, absurdly provocative polemics, and divisive rhetoric to make their points, are opinionated in perhaps the most pejorative sense of the word—they are <i>propaganda</i>. This critical incompetence, which leads these writers to proceed even to their vocation as propagandists <i>mal à propos</i>, is not accidental but necessary. These writings are not interested in furthering campus discourse as much as reacting to it by accentuating existing differences and labeling all those who disagree with them as traitors, terrorists, or at the very least, morally ossified."},{"content":"It is worth mentioning in this regard that these authors are not just individual students: they are representatives of organizations with access to massive local and national platforms. Yadegar, who formerly served as the president of Columbia SSI, led a chapter of a national organization that proudly states <a href=\\"https://www.ssimovement.org/uploads/2/3/8/3/23838525/ssi_2024_booklet.pdf\\">its promotion by bigoted far-right American media outlets</a> like The Ben Shapiro Show, whose host \\"celebrate[d] and laud[ed]\\" the actions of the Israeli military,<i> </i>and the National Review<i>,</i> which <a href=\\"https://x.com/RashidaTlaib/status/1837198454545862992\\">published racist caricatures of Arab Americans</a>—both instances just in the past few months.

After years of false promises and inconsistent communication, medication abortion is still not available on campus for Barnard students."},{"content":"Medication abortion on campus is crucial in ensuring that students and community members can conveniently access care. Access to abortion pills on college campuses makes costs more transparent, makes insurance coverage easier to navigate, and reduces obstacles in physically accessing reproductive care. A 2017 study of California abortion access found that a majority of University of California and California State University students need to spend <a href=\\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6469227-sb320-barriers12-20-2017.html#document/p1/a530180\\">a combined two hours or more</a> on public transit to access medication abortion and the necessary follow-up care at a regional facility. Distinct barriers persist for Barnard students in the local context of New York City, too.

Students who may be altogether unable to access medication abortion in their home states turn to their college campuses in less restricted states, like Barnard’s, for convenient support and transparent care. The importance of medication abortion access on Barnard’s campus—especially for those who may have nowhere else to turn—cannot be overstated."},{"content":"In May 2023, New York state legislators passed S1213B, a <a href=\\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S1213/amendment/B\\">bill</a> requiring City University of New York and State University of New York schools to provide access to medication abortion on their campuses, reducing the financial and logistical hurdles university students often face when trying to access reproductive healthcare. Upon the passage of the bill, a student advisory board was organized and facilitated by former Reproductive Justice Collective leadership working with Advocates for Youth, a youth sexual health, LGBTQ rights, and reproductive justice advocacy organization,"},{"content":"After Barnard agreed to provide medication abortion at its student health center, the logical next step for the Reproductive Justice Collective was to ensure that Barnard’s implementation of medication abortion was accessible to all students, grounded in transparent communication of the timeline and available services, and conscious of student concerns regarding the inadequacy of current emotional and practical support options on campus. For example, Barnard has not yet addressed how a student would communicate their abortion to a professor in the event they would need to miss class."},{"content":"In hopes of creating a channel of communication between administrators and students, the collective attempted to contact Barnard’s administration and worked with the Student Government Association to initiate a similar student advisory board for medication abortion at Barnard. Barnard eventually announced it would convene a single-session focus group on medication abortion. However, students who were contacted about scheduling a time for the session never received a follow-up."},{"content":"Without updating the student body on the status of medication abortion at Barnard and the absence of an accurate timeline for the rollout, the administration is allowing students and faculty to falsely believe that Barnard’s Primary Care Health Service is currently providing medication abortion—furthering the current campus climate of mistrust and administrative opacity."},{"content":"This semester, after more than a year of unanswered emails and vague, inconclusive announcements from administrators, Reproductive Justice Collective organizers have resorted to calling the health center and inquiring about the rollout of medication abortion at our own personal care appointments.

I fumbled my way into the Northwest Corner Building, struggled to get my Columbia ID out of my wallet while balancing my bag on my knee, was stopped by a security guard asking me to hold up my card, and took the escalator two steps at a time. I barely got to Earl Hall on time… and found the room empty."},{"content":"I texted my pastor."},{"content":"Two minutes later, he called and apologetically explained that there was no service at Columbia because guest access had been revoked for all church members due to anticipated protests."},{"content":"I reassured him that there was no need to apologize—that I completely understood—and we ended the call. I walked back through campus, out onto Broadway, and back to my apartment. The trip back was silent. Not only because I had nothing to say, but because campus was unusually calm. I saw a few hushed students studying on Earl Hall steps, but there were no loud noises and definitely no hint of protests."},{"content":"Angrier than I had been in a long time, I started typing as soon as I got home. Not only had service been canceled, but I had received no prior warning."},{"content":"Entitled “Columbia Actions on Religious Services,” my email was sent out at 2:18 p.m. on Sunday, October 6 to the Office of the President, the Office of the Provost, the Office of Institutional Equity, University Life, and the Office of Religious Life. Fifty-nine minutes later, coincidentally, interim University President Katrina Armstrong sent an email titled “Update for Our Community.”"},{"content":"Considering Armstrong’s email was received at 3:17 p.m., more than halfway through the day, and explicitly mentioned “today and tomorrow,” it had arrived far too late for a campuswide announcement about significant adjustments to University policy. Even if this update was already planned, and the email I sent changed nothing, the timing alone reveals a troubling truth about how the University operates—with impunity and negligence."},{"content":"First, the timing of this update tells me that the University is alarmingly tight-lipped about its policies to the detriment of its students. If the University was genuinely worried about “activities that raise concern about the potential for violence,” its communication came far too late. Waiting until Sunday to inform the student body about a “potential for violence,” despite those very students allegedly being the most endangered by said violence, betrays a clear lack of urgency. If violence was a genuine concern, it seems Columbia students weren’t a priority."},{"content":"Second, the University did not feel the need to publicize changes to guest access, thus failing to recognize how the late notice might affect both external guests and students living on campus. If this was a decision made ahead of time by the University, notice was only given to guests the day of. This included my pastor as well as any personal guests of the students, some of whom likely traveled quite a ways to get to campus. Much of the student body lives on campus; the residential buildings are their home. Does the University not deem it necessary to inform their residents about policies that affect their own living spaces in a timely manner? And if this was a decision planned in advance, why did the University decide not to update its student body until the middle of the day it was implemented?"},{"content":"The abruptness of this policy change seemed to also catch other administrations by surprise. Later that same day at 7:30 p.m., Law School students received an email entitled “IMPORTANT: Building Closures Tonight at 7 p.m.” That is, Columbia notified Law School students of the building closure 30 minutes after the building was supposed to close<i>. </i>I learned of this development before receiving the email from a group chat where a friend had been kicked out of the building at 7 p.m. Bad planning by an administration ceases to become a simple mistake—it becomes an act of negligence."},{"content":"The University justifies all this based on a commitment to its “academic mission.” Armstrong writes that the University “will be working closely with leadership across the schools and programs to determine where guest access is critical for our academic mission.” In the privileging of academic mission, I suppose that religious services have just fallen through the cracks. By choosing to let in only “critical” guests, the other visitors to the University were made invisible."},{"content":"If the University decides to operate with such a narrow focus, who suffers? Who is left out? The University leadership cannot claim to act with students’ well-being in mind when they create such huge barriers to access. Community, family, religion—are these considerations that the University has? Its actions suggest otherwise. Yet, these are often the relationships that bolster students, that give them comfort, and that allow them to settle into a new chapter of their lives with certainty and strength."},{"content":"In its narrow focus on its “academic mission,” the University fails to perceive how every aspect of a student’s life shapes the way they engage with the school. The University forgets how much sway it has in the daily lives of its students. So many students are also tenants of Columbia, spending years in these buildings—how much more must these unexpected policies affect them?"},{"content":"Armstrong ended her email, “I know that this incredible University community can navigate the challenges of the next several days with compassion, understanding and resilience.” But how can there be compassion, understanding, and resilience when the student body is neither included in the decision-making process nor given sufficient communication? Rather than protecting the community, these actions have fractured it."},{"content":"Patching up the cracks after a policy is implemented is not the same as bringing students to the table. The burden of troubleshooting a flawed policy should not fall on students, especially when the University’s decision-making process has been opaque. Despite all the emails about student feedback and rhetoric about fostering community, Columbia has repeatedly overlooked its primary charge again and again: its student body."},{"content":"The University must work to correct this. There should not be another email that comes much too late about a policy that has already taken effect. Columbia cannot decide that its community is one to be feared or dismissed; it cannot shut its students out. The University must embrace its community, consider them effective decision-makers, work with them, and at the very least, inform them."},{"content":"After all, what is a university without its students?"},{"content":"<br/>"},{"content":"<i>Gawon Jo is a first year Columbia Law student.</i>"},{"content":"<i>To respond to this op-ed, or to submit your own, contact </i><a href=\\"mailto:opinion@columbiaspectator.com\\"><i>opinion@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.</i>"}],"credits":{"by":[{"name":"Gawon Jo"}]},"description":{"basic":"Op-Eds"},"display_date":"2024-10-24T02:05:02.48Z","headlines":{"basic":"On that “Update for Our Community”"},"promo_items":{"basic":{"auth":{"1":"3ab045165d878b889f9920847de5247227050eb5bf5ac76dad822d78b77624ee"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/DJHSWAQBX5AEZHGPAT6U755BBM.jpg"}},"taxonomy":{"sites":[{},{},{}]}}],"_id":"672dac396edf7c18ce613724f1bd709e54c0f30142b4ceab392b558ddb9d0860"};Fusion.globalContentConfig={"source":"section-channel-service","query":{"uri":"/opinion/op-eds/1/","section":"opinion","channel":"op-eds","numArticles":"10","from":"0","arc-site":"spectator"}};Fusion.lastModified=1736731639988;Fusion.contentCache={};Fusion.layout=undefined;Fusion.metas={"title":{"value":"Columbia Daily Spectator","html":true}};Fusion.outputType="default";Fusion.template="template/tK7PRRQM3sJ45Rus";Fusion.tree={"collection":"layouts","props":{"collection":"layouts","childProps":[{"collection":"features","type":"CDSSectionChannel/CDSSectionChannel","id":"f0fzs1rx1al22Wl","contentConfig":{"contentService":"","contentConfigValues":{},"inherit":true},"customFields":{},"displayProperties":{},"localEdits":{},"variants":{}}]},"children":[{"collection":"features","type":"CDSSectionChannel/CDSSectionChannel","props":{"collection":"features","type":"CDSSectionChannel/CDSSectionChannel","id":"f0fzs1rx1al22Wl","contentConfig":{"contentService":"","contentConfigValues":{},"inherit":true},"customFields":{},"displayProperties":{},"localEdits":{},"variants":{}}}]};Fusion.spa=false;Fusion.spaEnabled=false;</script></body></html>
